This method is really a modification of the balanced tangential method.

This method assumes that the well path lies on a cylinder whose axis is vertical, and has a radius equal to the radius of curvature in the horizontal plane. It determines the length of the arc between the upper and lower ends of the course length in the horizontal plane.

The sensor system performance generally degrades as the inclination increases, especially in an east/west direction at higher latitudes. For magnetic tools, high latitudes result in weaker horizontal components of Earth\u2019s field. For two-axis gyro tools, the approach to east/west at high inclinations places the sensor axes increasingly parallel to Earth\u2019s spin. With magnetic tools, errors increase at high east/west inclinations because of the progressive difficulty in compensating for the effect of drill string magnetism.",

        "The Carter coordinate system is a land grid, based on latitude and longitude, used to locate oil and gas well data in Kentucky. The system was developed by the Carter Oil Company to mimic the township and range location system in areas that had not been surveyed. The State is divided into a regular grid with each cell (or \u0022quad\u0022) being five minutes of latitude by five minutes of longitude. These quads are assigned letters (equivalent of the township) beginning with \u0022A\u0022 in the south and increasing through \u0022Z\u0022 and \u0022AA\u0022 to \u0022GG\u0022 northward. The quads are assigned numbers (equivalent of the range) beginning with zero (0) in the west and increasing to 92 in the east. Each five-minute by five-minute quad is further subdivided into 25 one-minute by one-minute sections. Within the one-minute section, the location is pinpointed by specifying the distance from an adjacent pair of one-minute section boundaries to the well. The Carter coordinate is written by specifying a pair of footages from the one-minute section boundaries and the reference boundary (north, south, east, or west) for each, the one-minute section number, the five-minute quad letter, and the five-minute quad number. A Carter coordinate and topographic index map of Kentucky is available by request, contact the\u00A0Public Information Center\u00A0(Publication Sales)."

        "The\u00A0Dominion Land Survey\u00A0(DLS; French:\u00A0arpentage des terres f\u00E9d\u00E9rales, ATF) is the method used to divide most of\u00A0Western Canada\u00A0into one-square-mile (2.6\u00A0km2) sections for agricultural and other purposes. It is based on the layout of the\u00A0Public Land Survey System\u00A0used in the\u00A0United States, but has several differences. The DLS is the dominant\u00A0survey\u00A0method in the\u00A0Prairie provinces, and it is also used in\u00A0British Columbia\u00A0along the\u00A0Railway Belt\u00A0(near the main line of the\u00A0Canadian Pacific Railway), and in the\u00A0Peace River Block\u00A0in the northeast of the province. (Although British Columbia entered\u00A0Confederation\u00A0with control over its own lands, unlike the\u00A0Northwest Territories\u00A0and the Prairie provinces, British Columbia transferred these lands to the federal Government as a condition of the building of the Canadian Pacific Railway.
