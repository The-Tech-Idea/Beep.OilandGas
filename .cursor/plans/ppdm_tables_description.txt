Well Origin (WO)
A Well Origin is the location on
the surface of the earth or sea bed
where the drill bit is planned to
penetrate or does penetrate the
earth to establish or rework a Well.
2. Wellbore (WB)
A Wellbore is a path of drilled
footage, from the Well Origin
(top/start) to a terminating point
(bottom/end).
3. Wellbore Segment (WS)
A Wellbore Segment is a unique
drilled interval within the Well,
either the original Wellbore from
the Well Origin to the terminating
point, or additional footage from
a point in an existing Wellbore to
a new terminating point.
4. Wellbore Contact Interval (CI)
A Wellbore Contact Interval is a
measured depth range within a
Wellbore that is intended to put
the Wellbore into contact with
one or more stratigraphic zones
for the purpose of production,
injection or service.
5. Wellbore Completion (C)
A Wellbore Completion is a set
of one or more Wellbore Contact
Intervals that function as a unit to
produce or inject fluids.
6. Wellhead Stream (WHS)
A Wellhead Stream is a flow
of fluids through a conduit
determined by an installed
wellhead configuration.


Well sTaTuses
Well Status Facets
Well status and classification helps users describe wells so
that people can find the right set of wells based on one or
more common criteria (such as the kind of fluid produced,
or whether a well is producing or still in construction). While
this information is usually derivable from a good data store,
well status information provides us with helpful shortcuts.
In PPDM 3.9, users may decompose complex well status values into their constituent facets using
R_WELL_STATUS_XREF. When this is complete, the complex values obtained from regulators
or data vendors can be stored with each well or well component and decomposed as needed
through query into R_WELL_STATUS_XREF.
Well status values often contain more than one kind of information. These complex values can be
broken down into atomic, well defined specific information facets. Each facet contains values that
are standardized, defined and queryable.
• Each facet describes one property of an object
• Facets contain values that are mutually exclusive with values in other facets
• Facets may be hierarchical in nature (they may be granular)
• By combining information from many facets, users can group wells for many key functions
• Facets can be represented on a map through standard symbol sets

Software Application subject expanded
• Includes information about the functions
and uses of software applications
• Supports relationships between
software applications and data stores
or data sources
Directional Surveys subject expanded
• Supports location versions
• Supports more information about each
survey station
• Supports the definition of composite
directional surveys.
Other changes
IDENTIFIER columns
• Changed from varchar2(20) to
varchar2(40)
TYPE columns
• Changed from varchar2(20) to
varchar2(40)
DATES are defined using these rules:
• XXX_DATE is a native database DATE
data type
• XXX_DATE_DESC is a varchar2 (8)
that indicates the degree of precision
in the associated date, such as YYYY,
YYYYMM, YYYYMMDD, YYYYQQ
• XXX_DATE_STRING is a varchar2 that
is used rarely, and allows dates to
be stored as a text string. This is not
recommended best practice.
PDEN subject
• Add new columns for date descriptions
as XXX_DATE_DESC
• Remove DATES from PK and change to
DATE data type.
• Created New PK component PERIOD_ID
TIME values are defined using these rules:
• XXX_TIME_ELAPSED: to indicate that
the value represents a total amount of
elapsed time (and OUOM).
• XXX_TIME: Time of Day. Use of this
column must be accompanied by
TIMEZONE (and foreign key


Referential Integrity:The values in each reference table(named R_%)contain 
the preferred values that arewanted in your data tables.Foreign keys in other tables reference
 these tables.Beware of reference table validations that contain indirect FK relationships to the referencetable.
 The values in the indirect reference are not directly constrained by the referencetable,
 but by the parent table in the foreign key,such as shown in this example:
 2.Manage alternate spellings or codesAlternate codes,versions,
 spellings and so on are managed in the ALIAS table attached toevery reference table;
 these contain information to associate each version with thesoftware or company that it came from.
 If desired,convert back to the appropriate aliason output.
 3.Manage hierarchies or granularitiesSome reference lists contain natural hierarchies or levels of granularity(one value iscontained by or a more specific type of another value).
 Manage these hierarchies in theClassification Subject.Query from this decomposition if necessary
