## Key Calculations

### Allocation Formula
```
Well Allocation = (Well Production / Total Production) × Total Volume
```

### Royalty Formula
```
Royalty = (Gross Revenue - Deductions) × Royalty Interest
```

### Imbalance Formula
```
Imbalance = Nominated Volume - Actual Volume
Imbalance % = (Imbalance / Nominated Volume) × 100
```

### Net Volume Formula
```
Net Volume = Gross Volume × (1 - BS&W%)
```

## Data Flow

1. **Production** → Measurement → Run Tickets
2. **Run Tickets** → Allocation → Well/Lease Volumes
3. **Volumes** → Pricing → Revenue
4. **Revenue** → Royalty Calculation → Royalty Payments
5. **Revenue** → Sales Accounting → Financial Entries
6. **All Data** → Reporting → Internal/External Reports
