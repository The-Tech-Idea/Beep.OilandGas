# Oil Field Lifecycle Plan

## Overview
This plan outlines the complete lifecycle of an oil field, from exploration to decommissioning. The application is designed to be international, accommodating different processes, regulations, and cycles across regions.

## Phases
1. **Exploration**: Prospect identification, seismic surveys, drilling exploratory wells.
2. **Development**: Planning, construction, infrastructure setup.
3. **Production**: Operations, monitoring, optimization.
4. **Decommissioning**: Abandonment, environmental restoration.

## International Considerations
- Regulatory frameworks vary by country (e.g., EPA in US, HSE in UK, local laws in Middle East).
- Cultural and environmental factors influence processes.
- Currency, units, and reporting standards differ.

## Integration
- **UI/GFX**: User interfaces for visualization, dashboards, maps.
- **Calculations**: Engineering models for reserves, flow rates, economics.
- **Processes**: Workflows for approvals, reporting, maintenance.

## Separate Plans
- Production Accounting: See ProductionAccountingPlan.md
