# Exploration Phase Plan

## Overview
The exploration phase involves identifying potential oil fields through geological and geophysical studies.

## Processes
- Seismic data acquisition and interpretation.
- Geological mapping.
- Risk assessment and prospect evaluation.
- Drilling exploratory wells.

## International Variations
- In OPEC countries, state-owned entities lead exploration.
- In US, private companies with leasing from BLM.
- Environmental impact assessments required in EU.

## Calculations
- Volume calculations for potential reserves.
- Risk probability models.
- Cost estimation for exploration activities.

## UI/GFX
- Seismic data visualization tools.
- 3D maps of subsurface structures.
- Interactive prospect maps.

## Integration with Lifecycle
- Feeds into development planning.
