# Calculations Integration Plan

## Overview
Integration of various calculations for engineering, economic, and operational analysis.

## Types
- Reservoir engineering (DCA, nodal analysis).
- Economic (NPV, IRR, cash flow).
- Fluid properties (PVT analysis).
- Flow assurance (pipeline, choke).

## Across Phases
- Exploration: Reserve estimation.
- Development: Feasibility studies.
- Production: Optimization models.
- Decommissioning: Cost projections.

## International Aspects
- Units and standards (SI vs. imperial).
- Regulatory formulas.

## UI/GFX
- Input forms and result visualizations.

## Processes
- Automated calculation triggers in workflows.
