# Development Phase Plan

## Overview
Development involves planning and constructing the infrastructure for oil extraction.

## Processes
- Field development planning.
- Well drilling and completion.
- Pipeline and facility construction.
- Regulatory approvals and permitting.

## International Variations
- In Norway, strict safety standards from PSA.
- In Saudi Arabia, Aramco oversees development.
- Community engagement in indigenous lands (e.g., Canada).

## Calculations
- Reservoir simulation models.
- Economic feasibility studies (NPV, IRR).
- Material and equipment sizing.

## UI/GFX
- Gantt charts for project timelines.
- CAD drawings for facilities.
- Simulation visualizations.

## Integration with Lifecycle
- Transitions from exploration to production.
